# Licensing, and the KeePass Web Business Model

Let's be honest up-front: KeePass Web is a business. We charge you a subscription
to use our software. We use that money to build impeccable software that you can
trust.

We believe that password and secret management software is too important to be
poorly done because of lack of funding. But, conversely, we believe walling it
behind a proprietary corporate shield is wrong: allegiance to shareholders
shifts focus from security to profit. To balance these beliefs, we use a dual
license model.

## Dual license model

* Patrons, who pay a monthly subscription fee, get access to the latest features,
bug fixes, and security patches. Access is available through a private GitHub
repository (for the Patron to download and run locally, if wished) and a
Patrons-only area of our [online version][kpo]. This software is licensed under
a proprietary license and comes with an End-User License Agreement.

* Every year, on January 1, we snapshot the latest stable release and re-license
it under the [MIT license][mit]. This snapshot we then publish in a public GitHub
repository and at our [online version][kpo].

In short, Patrons get maximum features, security, and convenience in exchange
for their subscription. Everyone else gets a reliable password manager that's up
to a year out of date.
