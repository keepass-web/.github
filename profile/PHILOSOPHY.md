# Design and Development Philosophy

Software handling other people's secrets needs to be impeccably maintained,
obviously trustworthy, and vetted by unaffiliated third parties. These three
core principles drive every decision made for KeePass Web.

## Core Principles

Impeccability refers to the state of being "without mistakes or faults"[^1] and
manifests itself in KeePass Web through:
* Test coverage exceeding 95% of possible paths.
* Documentation that is easy to use, understand, and find[^2].
* No more than 5 verified open issues more than 90 days old across all the
  organization.

Trustworthiness is the "firm belief in the integrity, ability, or character of a
person or thing."[^3] What does that mean for KeePass Web? It means there's a
vibrant community of users who can vouch for it. It means the code is open and
available for you to inspect. It means the authors are responsive to good faith
questions.

To be vetted means "to be critically reviewed and evaluated"[^4]. For KeePass
Web, this means having the software application subjected to hacker research:
those bounty hunters who have a financial interest in finding security faults in
the architecture or implementation of KeePass Web.
